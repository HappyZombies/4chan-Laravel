# 4chan-Laravel
===================

![Mockup](mockup.png) 

A 4chan clone that is written in Laravel. Uses Twitter Bootstrap for front-end. 

Getting Started
-------------

You **need** to have [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) to run this site. 

* Create your .env file accordingly 
* You *may* need to update your config/database.php accordingly as well.
* composer install
* php artisan key:generate
* php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
* php artisan serve

And you're off! Not all features of 4chan have been implemented, but are in progress. Front-end will not look 100% like 4chan.org, but it will be fairly similar.
